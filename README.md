Virtual Mouse

This project involves the development of a virtual mouse that is controlled entirely by hand gestures. 
The MediaPipe's Hand Landmarks module accurately tracks and detects hand movements in real time.
Various hand gestures are mapped to corresponding mouse functions, such as;
1) index finger up to move the cursor
2) index and middle fingers up for left-click
3) index finger and thumb up for right-click
4) thumb for scrolling up and pinky finger for scrolling down.
PyAutoGUI is employed to simulate these mouse actions. The virtual mouse provides a user-friendly touch-free interface and a solution for gesture-based control in everyday computing tasks.
